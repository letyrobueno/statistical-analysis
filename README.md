# Statistical Analysis

## Concepts:

- **summary statistic:** a single number summarizing a large amount of data.
- Row = data point = observation;
- Column = field = feature = variable;
- dataframe = data matrix;
- **associated/dependent variables:** when two variables show some connection with one another;
- **independent variables:** when two variables are not associated;
- **dependent of independent, never both:** a pair of variables are either related in some way (dependent) or not (independent). No pair of
variables is both associated and independent.
- **explanatory variable:** one variable that might causally affect another;
- **response variable:** one variable that might be causally affected by another;
- **observational study:** when researchers collect data in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arise;
- **association != causation:** association does not imply causation, and causation can only be inferred from a randomized experiment;
- **anecdotal evidence:** data that only represents one or two cases, and may not be representative of the population;
- **convenience sample:** where individuals who are easily accessible are more likely to be included in the sample;
- **confounding variable:** a variable that is correlated with both the explanatory and response variables;
- **observational data:** data where no treatment has been explicitly applied (or explicitly withheld). Generally only sufficient to show associations or form
hypotheses that we can check using experiments;
